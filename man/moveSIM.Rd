\arguments{
\item{replicates}{Integer, desired number of replicates per run. Default 100.}

\item{days}{Integer, how many days (timesteps) would you like to model? Range (1,nlayers(env_rast))}

\item{modeled_species}{Object of class "species"}

\item{env_rast}{Rasterstack or Rasterbrick with number of layers >= days}

\item{optimum}{Numeric, optimal environmental value}

\item{dest_x}{Numeric, destination x coordinate (longitude)}

\item{dest_y}{Numeric, destination y coordinate (latitude)}

\item{mot_x}{Numeric, movement motivation in x direction, range (0,1], default 1.}

\item{mot_y}{Numeric, movement motivation in y direction, range (0,1], default 1.}

\item{search_radius}{Radius of semicircle search regions (in km). Default 375.}

\item{direction}{Character, movement direction, one of "N","S","E","W", or "R" (Random). Default "S".}

\item{sigma}{Numeric, randomness parameter, range (-Inf, Inf). Default 0.1.}

\item{mortality}{Logical, should low energy levels result in death? Default T.}

\item{fail_thresh}{What percentage deviation from optimum leads to death? E.g. default of 
.50 means 50 percent or greater deviation from optimum on a particular step constitutes failure.}

\item{n_failures}{How many failures are allowable before agent experiences death (at n_failures+1). What constitutes
a failure is determined by fail_thresh, range (1,days]. Default 4.}

\item{single_rast}{Logical, are you using a one-layer raster for all timesteps? Default F.}

\item{write_results}{Logical, save results to csv? Default F.}
}
\value{
Under "results", a (days+1 * replicates) row X 7 column dataframe containing data on agent_id, day, longitude, latitude,
current agent status (Alive, Stopped, or Died), distance traveled from last timestep (in km), and a plot_ignore column, which can be ignored by the user.
Using tidy_results() hides the plot_ignore column and provides overall nicer display of results.

Under "run_params", a record of function parameters used as well as missing_pct
and mortality_pct. missing_pct corresponds to the percent of rows in the results dataframe
missing information on lon/lat, which occurs when the agent has "died" or "stopped". mortality_pct
refers to the percentage of agents in the run that died.
}
\description{
Here, agent mortality occurs when agent fails to achieve suitable raster values
at least n_failures+1 timesteps in a row. Agent energy stores are not dynamic, so movement
speed isn't directly affected by quality of raster cells achieved. Results may be analyzed
with `moveVIZ()`. Relies on underlying function `moveSIM_helper`, which is not to be used
alone.
}
\details{
For each timestep, agents can have status "Alive",
"Stopped", or "Died". All agents start alive and may stop if, on a particular timestep,
there are no non-NA raster values in the search region. This often occurs when agents
are searching over an ocean or a large lake, for example. Once an agent stops, they
remain stopped for the rest of the run. Similarly, once an agent dies, they retain 
this status for all subsequent timesteps. All timesteps with agent status "Stopped"
or "Died" will have lat/lon=NA, so as to not affect subsequent analyses.

Arguments mortality, n_failures, and fail_thresh interact with each other. If 
mortality = F, values for n_failures and fail_thresh are ignored. If mortality=T, fail_thresh
determines what constitutes a failure, and n_failures indicates how many failures are allowed before
death. Note: If n_failures=days, this is equivalent to mortality=F.
